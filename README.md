testing zenodo releases

This GitHub repository is linked to the test Zenodo record at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6081432

Metadata is stored in .zenodo.json file. 

The following properties were attempted to be added, but resulted in a failure to update the record on Zenodo (note: not sure if this is actually a valid DOI for the EMERGE grant, which may account for the failure):
```
"grants": [{"id": "10.13039/100000001::2022070"}]
```

Additional properties used in an earlier version that failed, which haven't been re-tested because they're not strictly necessary for EMERGE dataset tracking:
```
"upload_type": "dataset"
```
